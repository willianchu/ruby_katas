# Lazy evaluation is an evaluation strategy that delays the assessment of an expression until its value is needed.

# Ruby  introduced a lazy enumeration feature. Lazy evaluation increases performance by avoiding needless calculations, and it has the ability to create potentially infinite data structures.

# Example:

power_array = -> (power, array_size) do 
    1.upto(Float::INFINITY).lazy.map { |x| x**power }.first(array_size) 
end

puts power_array.(2 , 4)    #[1, 4, 9, 16]
puts power_array.(2 , 10)   #[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
puts power_array.(3, 5)     #[1, 8, 27, 64, 125]
